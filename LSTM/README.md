# Swedish LSTM NLP

This is the source code for the neural network described in our Bachelor's Thesis, an LSTM neural network for grammar correction and spellchecking in Swedish.

Logs for our training as well as the best checkpoint can be found at: https://github.com/JohanG2012/Swedish_NLP_LSTM_Result

Please note that this code was written for our Bachelor's Thesis, mainly focused on finding good hyperparameters to use with an NLP LSTM. There is a lot of room for improvement and optimization.
