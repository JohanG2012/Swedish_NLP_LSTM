# Swedish LSTM NLP

This is the source code for our Bachelor Thesis. An LSTM neural network for grammar correction and spellchecking.

Logs for our training as well as the best checkpoint can be found at: https://github.com/JohanG2012/Swedish_NLP_LSTM_Result

If you are interested in out thesis, it can be found [here](https://github.com/JohanG2012/Swedish_NLP_LSTM/blob/master/Swedish%20Natural%20Language%20Processing%20with%20Long%20Short-term%20Memory%20Neural%20Networks%20-%20A%20Machine%20Learning-powered%20Grammar%20and%20Spell-checker%20for%20the%20Swedish%20Language.pdf)

Note: This is the code writen by us when we worked on our Bachelor Thesis. The thesis main focus was on hyperparameters. So there is alot of room for improvement and optimization.
